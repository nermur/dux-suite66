=== Cautionary tale about Windows dual-booting
[%collapsible]
====
Windows cannot be trusted; Windows 10 LTSC 2019 erased the partitions on my _previously_ ext4 formatted 4TB drive, and damaged that ext4 filesystem beyond repair.

NOTE: This drive was never mounted in Windows, and was not the primary disk; the primary disk had both Linux and Windows installed. +
It's 29 Nov 2021 and the same drive has seemingly no issues, being mainly a video archival drive as it was then; this damage caused by Windows happened in ~2019.

=== [Optional] Verify ISO authenticity
[%collapsible]
====

*macOS*

. Install Homebrew from https://brew.sh/  +
`brew install gnupg`

. Follow the Linux instructions below.

*Linux* 

. The full key (not short or long) is used to fully protect against collision attacks. +
`gpg --auto-key-locate clear,wkd -v --locate-external-key pierre@archlinux.de` 

. Check what the PGP fingerprint is, then download "PGP signature".
image:arch_checksums.png[]

. `gpg --full-gen-key`
```
Please select what kind of key you want:
   (1) RSA and RSA (default)
   (2) DSA and Elgamal
   (3) DSA (sign only)
   (4) RSA (sign only)
  (14) Existing key from card
Your selection? ↵

What keysize do you want? 4096 ↵
Key is valid for? ↵
```
NOTE: A "Real name" of at least 5 characters long is required; "Email address" and "Comment" are not.

. After your new GPG key has been generated, show its full key; [ultimate] indicates that you trust this key ultimately (you created the key), which is the desired behavior. +
`gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format none`

. Sign Arch's GPG key with yours. +
`gpg --sign-key 4AA4767BBC9C4B1D18AE28B77F2D434B9741E8AC`

. Verify if the ISO is authentic, and its file integrity doesn't fail (indicates a broken download). +
`gpg --verify /path/to/archkbd:[TAB].sig`

== Writing ISO to USB
WARNING: Will destroy all previous data on the targeted device.

NOTE: -> For `dd` <- +
`bs=8M` is optimal for most USBs. +
If desired, benchmark `bs=` from 2M up to 16M (increment by 2M) to reserve for future usage.

=== Windows
. Download and install rufus-$version.exe +
https://github.com/pbatard/rufus/releases
. Add the Arch ISO through Select, click Start, then write in DD Image mode.

=== macOS
. Use https://github.com/balena-io/etcher/releases[balenaEtcher].

=== Linux
. Use https://github.com/balena-io/etcher/releases[balenaEtcher].

.dd method (a not recommended alternative)
[%collapsible]
====
. Throughly list disks and partitions; to see what disk/drive you are going to format. +
`$ lsblk -o PATH,MODEL,FSTYPE,FSVER,SIZE,FSUSE%,FSAVAIL`

. Don't append numbers to the end of /dev/EXAMPLE +
`# dd if=/path/to/archkbd:[TAB] of=/dev/EXAMPLE bs=8M oflag=direct status=progress`
====

=== OpenBSD
. List all available disks: +
`$ dmesg|egrep '^([cswf]d). '` or `$ df -h`

. List the partitions of a disk, and show sizes in gigabytes (-p g): +
`# disklabel -p g EXAMPLE`

. Don't append numbers to the end of /dev/EXAMPLE: +
`# dd bs=4M if=/path/to/archkbd:[TAB] of=/dev/EXAMPLE conv=sync`
