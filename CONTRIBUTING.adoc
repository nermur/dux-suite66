=== These specific contributions won't be accepted, please make your own fork and be willing to give full support for it.

NOTE: The overall quality of Dux degrades when adding features/options that don't get daily use by the person that primarily added those features/options in the first place. +
You can expect higher quality from forking and doing this work yourself, since you know exactly why you want what you've added and how it should function, while I don't.

* Other Linux kernels, especially `linux-hardened`.

* Installers & uninstallers for other desktop environments, and any window manager setups.

* Option to disable Flatpaks.
** I would never test for this, that is the issue. Some Flatpaks are chosen on the basis that they function better than the Arch variant, and vice versa.

* Bootloaders with no support for Btrfs snapshots, such as `systemd-boot`.

* Alternative initramfs generators, such as Booster or Dracut.
** A lot can go wrong easily, in a similar way that changing Linux kernels could.

* UEFI secure boot support.

* Encrypted /boot support.

* Ricing oriented:
** Any plugins for GNOME.

* Alternative "inits" to systemd.
** It would be cool to see a fork of Dux that replaces systemd with link:https://skarnet.org/software/s6/[s6] + link:https://web.obarun.org/software/[suite66]. +
Inits besides systemd and s6 are problematic for a Dux fork in my opinion.
